# Redirector

This is a simple URL forwarding service configured for self hosting. It can generate random short URLs (e.g., `/r32xd`), named URLs (e.g., `party/june2`), or a combination (e.g., `/prefix/r3ce2`).

The goal of the project is to be relatively simple (it is backed by `.json` files instead of a database), but to allow self-registration, login, and link creation/deletion/modification. Users can only modify the links they create.

If you are using this in a dockerized environment under a prefix (say `go/`) the following `nginx.conf` rewrite rule may be uesful:

```
location /go {
    port_in_redirect   off;
    rewrite            ^/go(/.*) $1 break;
    rewrite            ^/go$ / break;
    proxy_read_timeout 240;
    proxy_pass         http://redirector:3000;
}
```
